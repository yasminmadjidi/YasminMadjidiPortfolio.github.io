		<h2>Name Assignment</h2>

			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>I used scratch to create a mini program that shows shows my name. I included a spinning ballerina to include my love for ballet. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them three unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene the the beginning each time the space key was pressed.</p>
			<h3>Concepts Learned</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Using event blocks - green flag clicked and when key pressed</li>
				<li>I used a forever block to make the ballerina continuously spin in a circle</li>
				<li>I used motion blocks to make my letters go to their positions and change their angles as well as return to their original location when the space key was pressed</li>
				<li>I used look blocks to change the costume of my letters</li>
			
		<h2>Computer Buying Project</h2>
			<p>
				<img scr="">
			<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>I used scratch to create a project in which I had to evaluate four different computer options for a particular customer and select which computer best met their needs. The requirements were to debate all of the parts of the computer (including the operating system, size, price, hard drive, memory, processor, keyboard, and speakers). The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked, include a computer comparison chart, and a reason for why the winning computer was chosen.</p>
			<h3>Concepts Learned</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Using event blocks- green flag clicked, when backdrop switches</li>
				<li>I used look blocks to show and hide sprites as needed, as well as to make my sprites talk with each other</li>
				<li>I used control blocks to act as a set timer</li>
				<li>I used motion blocks to change the location of my sprites as the slides changed</li>
