		<h3>Name Assignment</h3>
			<p>	
				<img src="images/name assignment.jpg" width="400" height="300">
			</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>I used scratch to create a mini program that shows shows my name. I included a spinning ballerina to include my love for ballet. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and give them three unique behaviors. The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the scene the the beginning each time the space key was pressed.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I used event blocks - green flag clicked and when key pressed</li>
				<li>I used a forever block to make the ballerina continuously spin in a circle</li>
				<li>I used motion blocks to make my letters go to their positions and change their angles as well as return to their original location when the space key was pressed</li>
				<li>I used look blocks to change the costume of my letters</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Computer Buying Project</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="images/computer project.jpg" width="400" height="300">
			</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>I used scratch to create a project in which I had to evaluate four different computer options for a particular customer and select which computer best met their needs. The requirements were to debate all of the parts of the computer (including the operating system, size, price, hard drive, memory, processor, keyboard, and speakers). The program needed to run when the green flag was clicked, include a computer comparison chart, and a reason for why the winning computer was chosen.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I used event blocks- green flag clicked, when backdrop switches</li>
				<li>I used look blocks to show and hide sprites as needed, as well as to make my sprites talk with each other</li>
				<li>I used control blocks to act as a set timer</li>
				<li>I used motion blocks to change the location of my sprites as the slides changed</li>
			</ul>	
		<h3>Final Project</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="images/final project.jpg" width="400" height="300">
			</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>For this assignment, I used scratch to create a game that kept score, used a timer, let the player know if they won, have a directions page, reset when the green flag was clicked, include various levels, and have the game stop when it was over. In my game, entitled Pinkie Ball, a pink ball must navigate through a maze without touching the black lines to reach the grey pad.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I used event blocks- green flag clicked, when backdrop switches, when key pressed</li>
				<li>I used broadcasts to end the game</li>
				<li>I used motion blocks to reset the location of the ball each time the level changed</li>
				<li>I used look blocks to show and hide sprites as needed, as well as to switch the backdrops</li>
				<li>I used data blocks to set and change the timer and level</li>
				<li>I used forever loops and if statements to set when the level would change or the game would end</li>
