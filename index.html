		<h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
		<p>
			I have been dancing for the past 6 years at Scripps Performing Arts Academy. I absolutely love all styles of dance, especially ballet. For the past 3 years I have been a Senior Company Member of Scripps Ballet Theatre, which is an all-youth ballet company. I dance about 16-19 hours a week and therefore dedicate almost all of my freetime to ballet. This past summer I received a scholarship to a summer program in New York with the American Academy of Ballet. I spent 3 weeks dancing about 5-7 hours a day and it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to my love for dance, I also play the piano and take part in several clubs at my high school. Last year I was president of the French Club and this year I took on the role of treasurer of the French National Honors Society. The French language has had a huge impact in my life and has driven me to want to live and work in France one day. 
		</p>

			My family also has a huge influence in my life. Juggling dance, school, and friends is extremely difficult, but my family is what keeps me grounded and pushes me to succeed in all aspects of my life. I also have a younger brother named Ryan who is the most annoying yet amazing person I know. My family and I travel a lot together. We have visited Canada, France, Germany, England, Austria, Scottland, Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, Mexico, New York, Chicago, Boston, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington D.C, Scottsdale, and San Fransisco.
