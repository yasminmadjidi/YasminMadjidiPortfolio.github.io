		<h2>Python Content</h2>
		<h3>Unit One</h3>
			<p>	
				<img src="Images/python.jpg" width="400" height="300">
			</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>In Unit One, we did several labs that taught us how to use variables, methods, and classes. The first lab asked us to write a program that takes user inputs and prints the results of several calculations. We put in our name, age, and current year and the program printed out our name and age as well as the year we were born. In the second lab we used methods to solve math tricks (pictured above). The third lab used classes and methods to create a class called Person that would load an image into a blank window.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I learned the basics of python such as using variables, methods, and classes</li>
				<li>I learned to write print statements</li>
				<li>I can create a blank window with a white background</li>
				<li>I learned to do math in python</li>
			</ul>	
		<h3>Unit Two</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="Images/pythonTwo.jpg" width="400" height="300">
			</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>Units Two’s main focus was on if-statements, if-else statements, and nested if-statements. The first lab instructed us to write a program that will prevent from walking off the screen. We used if-statements to move the person and set boundaries to keep it on the screen. The second lab involved if-else statements in order to stop the person from walking through other objects. The third lab allowed the person to jump a certain height before coming back to the ground which was achieved using nested if-statements (shown above). </p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I learned to use all types of if-statements</li>
				<li>I learned to make an object move and make it collide with other objects</li>
				<li>I learned to create a counter variable and make it increase under set conditions</li>
				
			</ul>	
		<h3>Unit Three</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="Images/pythonThree.jpg" width="400" height="300">
			</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>In Unit Three, we did labs involving loops, strings, methods, and nested loops. In the first lab we wrote a program to count down seconds until it reached 0 to teach us to use loops to repeat code a set number of times. The second lab decoded the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The third lab used loops and variables to draw multiple squares and circles that shrink over time. The final lab required us to use nested loop statements to use a grass tile to draw the ground and add rocks at random points. We then later used the ground to create a game in which the person moves around the ground to catch a coin and earn points in a set amount of time (shown above).</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I learned to use loops to make coding easier and faster</li>
				<li>I learned to create a timer</li>
				<li>I learned to assign random x and y positions to an object just as the rocks</li>
			</ul>	
		<h3>Unit Four</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="Images/pythonFour.jpg" width="400" height="300">
			</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>In Unit Four, we added all of our previous knowledge and added extra elements such as lists to complete the labs. In the first lab we used a list to load four different dude.gif files that were each facing a different direction so that when the person moved, he would be facing the direction he was traveling. The second lab made us use lists, loops, and ifs to draw different ground tiles on the ground (shown above). The last lab instructed us to use the ground from the second lab and use lists to draw enemies that would move across the screen. If the person collided with an enemy, the game would be over.</p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I learned to use lists</li>
				<li>I learned to program a scrolling background</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>Final Project</h3>
			<p>
				<img src="Images/candyCatcher.jpg" width="400" height="300">
			</p>
			<h4>Description</h4>
				<p>I created a game called Candy Catcher in which the user’s goal is to avoid the vegetables and to catch the candy. After each level, more vegetables will be added. The vegetables will randomly go across the screen while the candy will randomly change its location each time it is caught. The user’s score will increase by 1 each time they catch a candy, but if a candy isn’t caught, the score will remain the same. If the user accidentally catches a vegetable, the game will be over. The user will have 30 seconds to complete each task.  </p>
			<h4>Concepts Learned</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>I learned to add multiple levels to a game and incorporate a timer</li>
				<li>I learned to create a title page and ending page</li>
			</ul>
