		<h2>Why I like the movie</h2>
		<h4>I like this movie because it's based in the 1920's, which is by far my favorite time period, and that the storyline shows the highs and lows of life in the 1920's. I especially adore all of Daisy's dresses, Gatsby's huge parties, and the way that they mixed current music with music of the 1920's to really engage the viewers.</h4>
